# Driver-Activity-Oversight-System
Source code written in Python

This is a research project that detects drowsiness or distraction for any vehicle drivers at the wheel

It uses the dlib library, using the 68 landmarks to mark up a face. 

It detects drowsiness based on eye and mouth aspect ratios to detect yawns and eye shutting.

It detects when the driver is looking in a different direction as well

This code is an incomplete implementation of one of my works which are being considered for a publication
